# machine-learning
uses colab //https://colab.research.google.com/
upload data before running
the first blockshould run for the fiest time only then restart run time after that you could comment the first block(this for solvin some compatibility problem with colab)

the code load the data and prepaer it for the model to use it
the first part has :
1- simple liner regression 
2- liner regression 
3- polynomial Regression

the secon part has :
logistic regression 
note : for the logistc regression you should run it twice the first one without runnning the code bock :2.3 balancing data to train the model useing imbalanced data
the second run you should run the block to train the model with the balanced data
